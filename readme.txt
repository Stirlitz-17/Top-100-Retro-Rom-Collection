Hello everyone!

I'd like to share my compilation of the "TOP 100" games for each gaming console. It's worth noting that in some systems, the number may vary since not all of them have a full hundred games. Additionally, for systems like MAME, with over 45,000 games, narrowing it down to just 100 games is almost an impossible task.

I manually created each compilation with the aim of always including the best games from each system and genre. This way, I've crafted a more balanced and diverse version of each collection. It's important to mention that, for instance, in the 100 most famous games for PSX, I didn't want the majority of the list to be comprised of games from the Final Fantasy series. While they are outstanding games, it wouldn't be appropriate for a list to primarily focus on a single saga.

I genuinely believe that this list will appeal to most gamers. However, if it doesn't, there's a straightforward solution: you can download a 100-game package and customize it to your preferences. This is especially convenient today since many portable systems use microSD cards, and it spares you from scrolling through an endless list of useless games when collecting complete sets.

As of now, my compilation covers over 40 systems, and I'm continuously working on updates. I also avoid including low-quality systems or home consoles that churned out numerous mediocre games with little to no value in the world of video games.

I hope you enjoy these compilations, and I'd appreciate your feedback and suggestions for further improvements.

Thank you very much!
